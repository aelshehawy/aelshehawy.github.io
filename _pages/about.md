I am an Assistant Professor at University College London (UCL). I hold a PhD in Politics from the University of Oxford. I was a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford's King Center on Global Development. I visited Yale during my PhD, and before Oxford, I studied at Mannheim, focusing on Advanced Quantitative Methods in Political Science.

My research focuses on topics related to the Political Economy, Development, and Historical Political Economy, with a focus on identity and inequality.

My methodological expertise lies in the field of Computational Social Sciences. I employ and advance methods of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Text Analysis in a multilingual setting, working with a variety of Western and Arabic languages.

My work incorporates retrieval and digitalization of historical maps, textual data, and several other sources of archival data. I am passionate about using my computational skills to generate new sources of quantitative data that reveal valuable information that would be otherwise lost in the archives.

My research has been published or is forthcoming at the Journal of Politics, Perspectives on Politics, and Journal of Peace Research.

I am a former professional swimmer for the Egyptian Swimming National Team, for which I competed professionally for several years. I still find myself thinking more clearly while doing all those endless laps at the pool. I enjoy reading about Islamic Art and Architecture.
