> **Abstract:**  
> What drives the supply of crime news? While prior research focuses on the news media, we study a crucial upstream gatekeeper of information: the police. We argue that the police act as strategic bureaucrats who increase the disclosure of out-group cues (ethnicity, nationality) when immigration is salient to signal competence and transparency to the public.  
>  
> To test this, we use LLMs to annotate a dataset of about one million press releases from German police stations (2014–2024). Using a regression discontinuity in time design, we show (1) an increase in out-group cues after a nationwide immigration shock (Cologne New Year’s Eve events), and (2) more out-group cues just before regional elections where immigration is a salient issue.  
>  
> Our findings show how bureaucratic discretion shapes politically charged information.
