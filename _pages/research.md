**Abstract:**  
> What drives the supply of crime news? While prior research focuses on the news media, we study a crucial upstream gatekeeper of information: the police. We argue that the police act as strategic bureaucrats who increase the disclosure of out-group cues (ethnicity, nationality) when immigration is salient to signal competence and transparency to the public.  
>  
> To test this, we use LLMs to annotate a dataset of about one million press releases from German police stations (2014–2024). Using a regression discontinuity in time design, we show (1) an increase in out-group cues after a nationwide immigration shock (Cologne New Year’s Eve events), and (2) more out-group cues just before regional elections where immigration is a salient issue.  
>  
> Our findings show how bureaucratic discretion shapes politically charged information.

5. **Named-Entity Recognition with Application to Foreign Leader Mentions in Congressional Speeches**
<details>
  <summary><strong>Show Abstract</strong></summary>

**Abstract:**  
> Why do country leaders assume greater salience to outsiders in some - but not other, cases
in international relations? The election interventions literature has argued that when the pol-
icy positions of candidates running in elections grow further apart, outsiders are more likely
to back the candidates they find most congruent, by using direct support of a candidate (via
promises of aid, for example) or by calibrating support for democratic processes in a country
to make the victory of the preferred candidate more likely. We build on this research agenda
to argue that policy polarization in a country will increase the salience of individual leaders
to outside actors: it now literally makes a difference who will be in power. Noticing - and
supporting leaders - becomes important. We test our argument about leader salience by scrap-
ing speeches made on the floor of U.S. Congress and leveraging innovative Natural Language
Processing methods. We show that policy divergence between the positions of candidates run-
ning in elections abroad gets them more personal recognition in Congress. We also show that
leader mentions contain words that are associated with an interest in helping foreign leaders get
elected. Our method and measure can help advance research on the importance of individuals
in politics more broadly.
